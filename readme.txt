== Description ==
User's have all kinds of devices these days and your site needs to look the best it can when being displayed, pinned or added to your users system.

OS Integration supports the following features:

* Generation of favicon.ico, up to 96x96px.
* PNG favicon support in multiple resolutions (16, 32, 96, 160 and 196px)
* Windows 8 and 8.1 Live Tiles in all sizes
* Windows 8 Live Tile update feeds (both through buildmypinnedsite.com and local XML files)
* iOS Touch Icon support in multiple resolutions (57, 72, 114, 144px)
* iOS Web App support including loading screen

All of the above can be supported with a single image supplied by you to the plugin and all the required formats will then be generated by OS Integration.

Optionally you can also supplied a custom wide formatted imaged or override any or all the generated images with custom selections.

Why use 2, 3 or 4 other plugins when OS Integration does all the work for you!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Some image sizes are not generating? =

You must provide an image larger than 450x450 (or 450x281 for the wide image).  If a smaller image is supplied it the code will not resize them to a larger format.

= What libraries are required? =

The WordPress image editor is used to resize the images, which supports both GD and Image Magic.

= I don't have GD but I do have Image Magic, but the Apple Icons are broken, what's wrong? =

The Image Magic code is still in development and may not function at this time.
